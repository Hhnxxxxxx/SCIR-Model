# SCIR-Model
Explore disease spread dynamics using SCIR model.

## Overview

This repository contains all resources for our project on disease spread simulation using the SCIR model. We extend the classic SIR framework by introducing asymptomatic carriers and modeling inter-population travel. The repo includes the final paper, MATLAB simulation scripts, and selected result figures.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

- `Paper` contains the PDF of the paper.
- `Scripts` contains the MATLAB scripts used for simulation.
- `Other` contains some figure results used in the paper.

This project was developed in collaboration with [@l-r-x](https://github.com/l-r-x).
